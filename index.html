    <p class="about-me-text">Hello there! My name is Daniel, and I just recently started a
      new position at Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a Support Engineer. I work on the AWS Marketplace Managed
      Catalog Operations team, enabling software sellers to publish their products on the AWS Marketplace.
      <br> <br> Before this position, I worked at Fannie Mae as a Software Engineer, focusing on application
      infrastruture, security, and IT operations and maintenance. While at Fannie Mae, I developed an
      efficient process for managing operations, troubleshooting, and regular maintenance
      that is crucial to success in IT &#8212; and the tech industry in general. <br><br> In 2020, I
      graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a major in Computer Science. This gave me a good foundation of knowledge, but I am rapidly learning
      more and expanding my skillset through my work, side projects, and individual learning. <br><br>This page
      will be updated as I continue to grow as a professional, so stay tuned! In the meantime, feel free to
      follow me on the below social media platforms: <br><br> </p>

          <p class="experience-desc">I work on the AWS Marketplace MCO (Managed Catalog Operations) team,
            working directly with our customers who are looking to sell their software
            products on AWS Marketplace. A seller submits a request to publish their
            product to the marketplace, my team picks it up, and we work on vetting,
            cloning, validating, and editing the product to make it ready to be published, with
            customer feedback through the whole process. Every product on AWS Marketplace
            was published by my team. I hope to gain experience in understanding customer
            needs, working efficiently to meet those needs, and utilizing AWS services to do so.</p>

          <p class="experience-desc">Fannie Mae uses a COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) suite of software
            products offered by SWIFT. to facilitate financial messaging with
            banks and financial institutions. I was on a small team that was in charge
            of designing the infrastructure behind this software to have high reliability,
            security, and fault tolerance in an on-premises environment. Monitoring and
            analytics saw a huge updgrade after I joined, as I implemented several monitoring
            scripts, created an all-encompassing dashboard in Splunk, and created alerts to
            lower our SLA on Production incidents. I gained valuable skills in system design,
            operations, security, and maintenance, which were especially important with the
            large amounts of cash and securities Fannie Mae moves through the SWIFT platform
            to and from other banks every day. </p>

            Technical University summer internship program, completing project work
            for my immediate team, while also being part of an intern-only team project.
            Within my immediate team, I used tools such as Hive tables, SQL, PySpark,
            and Power BI to filter, format, and visualize big data to gain insights into
            MetLife's reinsurance business. On my intern team, I led the team to design
            an app and develop a business plan to help MetLife's effort to become carbon-neutral
            by offering auto insurance discounts to MetLife customers who opt to carpool. The
            app allowed coworkers and friends to coordinate carpooling opportunities,
            pickup times, and drop-off locations, while linking with their insurance profile
            to offer tiered discount rewards. </p>

          of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while using Java and Selnium to write programs
          that automated actions on Mercury web pages for quality assurance and testing.
          I used Selenium web drivers to automate how an end-user would interact with a
          web page&#8212;to enter an auto insurance claim, for example&#8212;in order to ensure that
          our web pages were responding to those interactions correctly and smoothly.</p>
