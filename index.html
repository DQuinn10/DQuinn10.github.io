        a support engineer at AWS. <br><br> I started my journey in software as a freshman
        in college, and I've learned so much since then. My career thus far has
        been focused on infrastructure, operations, system administration, and
        cloud computing, but I am currently learning new things in the worlds of
        web development, databases, and big data. <br><br> I am also working on getting several
        associate- and professional-level AWS certificates to aid in my understanding
        of the cloud and AWS services, which is especially helpful in my current role
        assisting customers in listing and selling their software products on the AWS Marketplace.
        <br><br> Seeing as I'm early in my career, I am still growing as a professional, and I know I have
        a lot to learn. This page will be updated as I continue my journey in software,
        so stay tuned! In the meantime, feel free to follow me on social media or
        shoot me an email to discuss tech, sports, or the cinematic masterpiece
        that is Kung Fu Panda!

      <p class="experience-desc">I currently work on the AWS Marketplace MCO (Managed Catalog Operations) team,
        working directly with our customers who are looking to sell their software
        products on AWS Marketplace. I review, test, and publish products submitted
        by sellers, and I ensure the experience for both those sellers and their buyers
        is flawless. I've worked with several AWS services including EC2, S3, and CloudFormation, and I've
        used SQL and JavaScript to create an automated tool for processing product listing requests
        in a fraction of the time. </p>

      <h5 class="experience-years">2020 - 2021</h5>
      <p class="experience-desc">Fannie Mae uses a suite of software
        products offered by SWIFT to facilitate financial messaging with
        banks and financial institutions. My team was in charge
        of designing the infrastructure behind this software to have high reliability,
        security, and fault tolerance in an on-premises environment. Monitoring and
        analytics saw a huge updgrade after I joined, as I implemented several monitoring
        scripts, created an all-encompassing dashboard in Splunk, and created alerts to
        lower our response time on Production incidents. I gained valuable skills in Unix, system design,
        operations, security, and platform maintenance. </p>

      <p class="experience-desc">I spent my 2019 summer as part of the MetLife
        Technical University summer internship program, completing project work
        for my immediate team, while also being part of an intern-only team project.
        Within my immediate team, I used tools such as Hive tables, SQL, PySpark,
        and Power BI to filter, format, and visualize big data to gain insights into
        MetLife's reinsurance business. On my intern team, I led the team to design
        an app and develop a business plan to help MetLife's effort to become carbon-neutral
        by offering tiered auto insurance discounts to MetLife customers who opt to carpool. </p>

      <p class="experience-desc">While interning at Mercury, I learned the basics
      of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while using Java and Selnium to write programs
      that automated actions on Mercury web pages for quality assurance and testing.
      I used Selenium web drivers to automate how an end-user would interact with a
      web page&#8212;to enter an auto insurance claim, for example&#8212;in order to ensure that
      our web pages were responding to those interactions correctly and smoothly.</p>
