      <p class="about-intro">I'm Daniel Quinn, a Software Engineer at Fannie Mae. I am currently transitioning to a Support Engineer role at Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
      <p class="about-background">I started learning programming when I went to college at the University of Notre Dame. Coding piqued my interest in a freshman year
      introductory engineering class, when we had a project that used MatLab. It was then I decided to major in Computer Science and make coding the basis of my
      career. I ended up taking a wide variety of computer science courses outside of the core requirements, including Computer Graphics, Visual Effects, Computer Vision,
       Data Science, Computer Security, and Human-Centered Design. My passions in the field were always front-end development, design, and big data.</p>
      <p class="about-work">I took a job out of college as a Software Engineer at Fannie Mae, working primarily in the cloud infrastructure area. My team owns, manages,
      maintains, and automates a COTS application that allows Fannie Mae to send and receive financial messages to and from banks around the country. I gained experience
       in security, application infrastructure, fin-tech, and cloud architecture technologies. I also got certified as an AWS Cloud Practitioner during my time at Fannie Mae.<br>
      I am now starting a new position as a Support Engineer for Amazon on the AWS Marketplace team, working with external software vendors to help them best position themselves
      on the AWS Marketplace to sell their software to AWS customers as third-party solutions that integrate within an AWS infrastructure.</p>
